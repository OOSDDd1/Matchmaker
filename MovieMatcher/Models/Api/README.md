# Explanation

All of these classes are autogenerated by [json2csharp.com](https://json2csharp.com/json-to-csharp).

The properties do not follow naming conventions and can unfortunately not be changed.

One of the classes will be named Root. 

Rename this one to the item you were querying (eg. /{id}/similar becomes Similar).

This root class must implement IRoot to reassure nothing will break.
