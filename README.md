# MovieMatcher

Streaming content is nowadays the most normal thing to do. Everyone has heard of it; Netflix, HBO Max, Amazon Prime, Disney+, Hulu, and many more. Netflix was founded because of consumer unfriendliness. The founders wanted an easy and cheap way to rent a movie, so the user had one place to watch a show or movie where and whenever they wanted. Many likewise services have popped up because of Netflix's staggering success, which means the consumer is back at square one. Here is where MovieMatcher comes into play.

MovieMatcher is an application that matches movies and series to the user and offers an all-in-one subscription to all streaming services. The application has a dedicated page for recommending movies and series to the user. These recommendations are built upon the previous recommendations the user liked. If the user spends more time in the application and rates more movies and shows, the recommendations will become more and more accurate. 

## Setup

1. Copy `MovieMatcher/prev.appsettings.json` to `MovieMatcher/appsettings.json`.
2. Fill in variables.
3. Use like this: `MainWindow.Config["config-key"]`.

## Run
Before you run the application run the following command in a terminal.
```shell
ssh -L 1433:localhost:1433 student@145.44.233.161
```
You will be asked for a password. This is the same as the password for the database.
