# Explanation

All of these classes are autogenerated by [json2csharp.com](https://json2csharp.com/json-to-csharp). Make sure to select `Use Pascal Case` and `Add JsonProperty Attributes` in the settings.

One of the classes will be named Root. Rename this one to the item you were querying (eg. /{id}/similar becomes Similar).
This root class must implement IRoot to reassure nothing will break.
